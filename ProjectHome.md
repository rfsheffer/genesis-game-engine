NOTE: The goals of this project are changing. The project has evolved into more of a toolset to compliment other engines since that is what I use it for most of all. So instead of considering this project a game engine, consider it a foundation for one, or a companion to an already existing engine.

Key pieces to note if you are looking for the companion parts of the foundation are the utilities folder and scripting folder.

Please note that this project is a side project of mine, I only update it as I find time from my regular job in game development, which needless to say isn't much spare time.

ALSO NOTE: The foundation is still in very early stages of development, and nothing is in complete WORKING order yet.

The key goals:

- Client / Server architecture

- Multi-platform support (MAC, IOS, Android, Linux, Windows)

- Networking foundation

- Data oriented code design

- Component based game system example

- Multi-threading wherever possible and practical

- Integrated third party scripting language (Python and Squirrel)


Another amazing engine companion is LibSDL and I won't be working on anything that already does well.
